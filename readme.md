# Picture in Picture

This is an app that will allow you to open any screen, application, or tab in a movable, resizable, window that will stay on top of anything you do. So you can have a tutorial video in the corner of your screen while you are working on something in the background.

This project is from [Zero to Mastery: Jacascript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/javascript-projects).
This is project 3 / 20.

2. When you make your selection, click "Start" to begin picture in picture!

## Thoughts

I cannot belive how simple this project was. I think picture in picture is an incredibly useful feature, and I never would hav thought I could have made this in 30 LOC. Really not even 30, if you take out the whitespace.
